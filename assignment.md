## Assignment

### Brief

Continue this assignment from where the lesson is left off. You are to configure a job called `build-and-push` to publish docker image to the docker hub registry (use the education-space registry) only when the test job passed.

Hint:
- Use Docker Orbs
- Setup environmental variables that contain username and password that login to docker hub

### Challenge

Attempt to create the pipeline configuration file for the Flask Docker App for the previous assignments to build and push to Docker hub (no need for test step).
